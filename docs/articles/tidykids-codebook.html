Data are drawn from Head Start Program Fact Sheets and Program Information Report (PIR) data.  Total Head Start allocations were multiplied by the share of children enrolled in private grantees  Funding awarded to state and local governments was not included, because already included in PK12ed.","Public spending on TANF cash assistance payments by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are drawn from the annual TANF expenditure data on basic cash assistance. It includes federal and state (including state MOE, state match, state separate programs). Data for 1996-1998 include spending on AFDC. There is one negative value (Arizona in 2013), reflecting an accounting adjustment for overreporting of expenditures in prior years.","Public spending on other cash assistance payments and social services by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are from the Census Bureau's annual State and Local Government Finance Survey, expenditure variables E67, E68 (J67 and J68 starting in 2005), E75, and E79, lessTANF cash assistance (TANFbasic).","Public spending on SNAP benefit payments that go to children by state and year, in $1,000s. Total benefits data are from the Federal Nutrition Service's SNAP Data Tables (Persons, Households, Benefits), multiplied by the percent of child participants from the annual Characteristics of SNAP Households reports.","Public spending on Social Security payments that go to children by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are drawn from SSA's Annual Statistical Supplement, Tables 5.J4 and 5.J10. Total monthly benefits to children are multiplied by the percentage of recipients under age 18.","Federal spending on SSI payments that go to children by state and year, in $1,000s. Average annual benefits to children under 18 are estimated using Tables 10 and 11 from the SSA's Annual Statistical Report, and then adjusted to exclude federally administered state supplements. State SSI payments are excluded because already included in othercashserv.","Federal spending on EITC, including refundable and non-refundable portions, by state and year, in $1,000s. Federal EITC spending comes from the IRSâ€™ Statistics of Income Historic Table 2 and include both the refundable and non-refundable portions of the credit.","Public spending on the Child Tax Credit, including refundable and non-refundable portions, by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are from the IRS' Statistics of Income Historic Table 2.","Public spending on the Additional Child Tax credit, including only refundable portion, by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are from the IRS' Statistics of Income Historic Table 2.","Total state spending on EITC by state and year, in $1,000s. State EITC spending for 1998 through 2008 (other than District of Columbia) comes from the Rockefeller Institute of Government. For other years, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, we set expenditures to zero for state-years with state EITC rates of zero (as documented by the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research). We otherwise impute expenditures by multiplying reported federal EITC expenditures in each state by the state EITC rate, then adjusting by 90% if the state EITC is refundable, and by 84% if the state EITC is non-refundable. In certain cases, we collected state EITC expenditures directly from state agency websites; these include California in 2016, and Ohio in 1997 and 2009-2016, and Wisconsin in 1997-2016.","Public spending on Unemployment Compensation benefit payments by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are from the Census Bureau's annual State and Local Government Finance Survey, expenditure variables Y05 and Y06.","Public spending on Workers Compensation benefit payments by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are from the Census Bureau's annual State and Local Government Finance Survey, expenditure variable Y14.","Public spending on Medicaid (for children and youth &lt;21) and CHIP by state and year, in $1,000s. Medicaid data are from the RAND Statistics database for total Medicaid expenditures (federal and state, including administrative costs), multiplied by an estimated share of expenditures on individuals &lt; 21 (based on authors' estimates, drawing from unpublished tabulations of the Medicaid Management Information System [MMIS] data). Total CHIP spending is from MACPAC's Annual Medicaid and CHIP Data Book Exhibit 32, formerly Table 8, (2012-2015), and historic data from the Rockefeller Institute of Government (1998-2011). Two caveats about the Medicaid estimates.  First, the share of expenditures on individuals &lt; 21 was estimated using one method for 1998-2008 and a different method for  2010-2016,  and 2009 was imputed as the average of 2008 and 2010).  The change in methods leads to a possible discontinuity between 2008 and 2010, particularly in NM.  Second, because of missing MSIS data,  the share of expenditures on individuals&lt; 21 was imputed for 1 state in 2012 (CO);  2 states  in 2013 (CO and RI);  6 states in 2014 (AK,CO, FL, KS, NC, RI);  31 states in 2015 (AL, AK, AZ, CO, DE, DC, FL, HI, IL, IN,KS,KY,LA, ME, MD, MA, MT,NE,NV,NH,NM,NC,ND,OH,OK,RI, SC,TX,VA,WA,WI)  and all 51 states in 2016.  These imputations were based on prior year data combined with information about Medicaid expansion status. Data are missing for 1997.","Public spending on public health efforts by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are from the Census Bureau's annual State and Local Government Finance Survey, expenditure variable E32.","Public spending on health vendor payments and public hospitals, excluding Medicaid, by state and year, in $1,000s. Data are from the Census Bureau's annual State and Local Government Finance Survey, expenditure variables E74 and E36 less Medicaid_CHIP.
