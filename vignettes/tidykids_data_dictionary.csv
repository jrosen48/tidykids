Medicaid data are from the RAND Statistics database for total Medicaid expenditures (federal and state, including administrative costs), multiplied by an estimated share of expenditures on individuals < 21 (based on authors' estimates, drawing from unpublished tabulations of the Medicaid Management Information System [MMIS] data). Total CHIP spending is from MACPAC's Annual Medicaid and CHIP Data Book Exhibit 32, formerly Table 8, (2012-2015), and historic data from the Rockefeller Institute of Government (1998-2011). Two caveats about the Medicaid estimates.  First, the share of expenditures on individuals < 21 was estimated using one method for 1998-2008 and a different method for  2010-2016,  and 2009 was imputed as the average of 2008 and 2010).  The change in methods leads to a possible discontinuity between 2008 and 2010, particularly in NM.  Second, because of missing MSIS data,  the share of expenditures on individuals< 21 was imputed for 1 state in 2012 (CO);  2 states  in 2013 (CO and RI);  6 states in 2014 (AK,CO, FL, KS, NC, RI);  31 states in 2015 (AL, AK, AZ, CO, DE, DC, FL, HI, IL, IN,KS,KY,LA, ME, MD, MA, MT,NE,NV,NH,NM,NC,ND,OH,OK,RI, SC,TX,VA,WA,WI)  and all 51 states in 2016.
